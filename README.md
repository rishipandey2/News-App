# News App - Android Development

Welcome to the News App project! This project will be covered in a series of videos, and by the end of it, you will have built a fully functional News app for Android. The project will take approximately six videos to complete.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will be diving into advanced Android topics to build a news app. We will cover five major concepts in-depth:
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: We will implement the MVVM architecture to maintain a clean separation of concerns in the app.
- **Retrofit**: Retrofit will be used to fetch news data from a remote server.
- **Navigation Components**: We will set up navigation components to handle transitions between different screens of the app.
- **Coroutines**: We'll integrate coroutines for asynchronous tasks such as fetching data from APIs.
- **Room Database**: We'll implement a local database to store the news articles for offline usage.

This is an advanced project, so make sure you're comfortable with each of these topics before diving in.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, it's recommended to revise the following topics:
1. MVVM Architecture
2. Retrofit for API calls
3. Navigation Components
4. Coroutines for background tasks
5. Room Database for local storage

## Features

- Fetches real-time news articles from an API using Retrofit.
- Displays news articles in a list format with images and text.
- Stores news data locally using Room for offline access.
- Navigates between screens with ease using Navigation Components.
- Handles background tasks such as data fetching using Coroutines.
